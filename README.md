# Coffee-Shop-Sales-Insight
This project aims to analyze retail sales data to uncover actionable insights that can boost the performance of a Coffee Shop. 

## My Process
### Data Collection and Cleaning
I started by collecting the sales data, which I then imported into Excel. Using the Power Query Editor, I cleaned and preprocessed the data to ensure its accuracy and reliability. This process involved removing duplicates, addressing missing values, and transforming the data into a structured format suitable for detailed analysis.

### Analysis and Dashboard Creation
After cleaning the data, I created pivot tables to summarize it effectively. These tables served as the foundation for generating insightful visualizations. I then designed and built an interactive dashboard in Excel, which provides a clear view of the sales performance across different dimensions such as time, product category, and store location.

## Conclusion
Through this project, I demonstrated how data-driven insights can be harnessed to enhance the performance of a Coffee Shop. By gaining a deep understanding of customer behavior, peak sales times, and product preferences, I am confident that these insights can inform better strategic decisions and help optimize operations and increase revenue.
